# Template Workshop: An opinionated setup for making workshops as open educational resources

{{< include /docs/includes/_badges.qmd >}}

This repository contains a template for setting up a new workshop
repository that will contain files to create a website for a workshop
and that might also be used as an open educational resource (OER).
Use this template to quickly get started with a new workshop with all
the necessary files and configurations in place for a smoother
"developer experience" and to have [continuous
delivery/deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)
of the workshop website and archival to Zenodo.
