# Changelog

Since we follow [Conventional
Commits](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-conventional-commits)
when writing commit messages, we're able to automatically create formal
"releases" of the workshop based on the commit messages. Releases in the
context of workshops are simply snapshots in time of the workshop
content. The releases are published to Zenodo for easier discovery,
archival, and citation purposes. We use
[Commitizen](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-semantic-release-with-commitizen)
to be able to automatically create these releases, which uses
[SemVar](https://semverdoc.org) as the version numbering scheme.

Because releases are created based on commit messages, we release quite
often, sometimes several times in a day. This also means that any
individual release will not have many changes within it. Below is a list
of the releases we've made so far, along with what was changed within
each release.

If you attended a workshop or used the workshop material as some point
in time, you can always refer to this changelog page to find out what
has been changed since you last used it.
