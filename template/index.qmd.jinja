<!-- TODO: Add a short description and motivation of the workshop here. -->

This ((TODO: length)) workshop is a ((TODO: Short description of the workshop.))
It is designed for doing participatory live-typing, where the teacher
demonstrates the tasks on their computer connected to a projector while learners
type along on their own computer. The workshop also includes reading tasks,
discussion activities, and hands-on exercises.

This website contains all of the material for the workshop, including
readings, exercises, presentations, live-typing material, and images. It
is structured as a book, with "chapters" as sessions, in order of
appearance. We make heavy use of the website throughout the workshop
where "type-along" sessions almost identically follow the material on
the website (with slight modifications for time or more detailed
explanations).

Check out the overview section of the workshop, starting with the
[Syllabus](/overview/syllabus.qmd).

If you plan on attending the workshop, please make sure to complete the
[Pre-workshop tasks](/pre-workshop/overview.qmd) to get set up and ready
for the workshop. The pre-workshop tasks include a survey that you need
to fill out before the workshop starts.

## Target audiences

This website and its content are targeted to three groups:

1.  For the **learners** to use during the workshop, both to follow
    along and also to use as a reference after the workshop ends. A more
    detailed description of who the learner is can be found in [Is this
    for you?](/overview/is-this-for-you.qmd)
2.  For the **teachers** to use as a guide for when they do the
    type-along sessions.
3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much
    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a
    guide to running and teaching their own workshops.
