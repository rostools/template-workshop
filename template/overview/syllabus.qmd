## Is this workshop for you? {#sec-is-it-for-you}

To help manage expectations and develop the material for this workshop, we
make a few assumptions about *who you are* as a participant in the
workshop:

-   Assumptions

While we have these assumptions to help focus the content of the workshop,
if you have an interest in learning R but don't fit any of the above
assumptions, *you are still welcome to attend the workshop*! We welcome
everyone, that is until the workshop capacity is reached.

In addition to the assumptions, we also have a fairly focused scope for
teaching and expectations for learning. So this may also help you decide
if this workshop is for you.
