# Is this for you? {#sec-is-this-for-you}

To help manage expectations and develop the material for this workshop,
we make a few assumptions about *who you are* as a participant in the
workshop.

We assume you can relate to one or more of the following:

-   TODO: List assumptions

While we have these assumptions to help focus the content of the
workshop, if you have an interest in the workshop but don't fit any of
the assumptions, *you are still welcome to attend*! We welcome everyone
until capacity has been reached.

In addition to the assumptions above, the workshop also has a fairly
focused scope, which may also help you decide if this workshop is for
you:

-   TODO: List of concrete tasks we will do and not do.
