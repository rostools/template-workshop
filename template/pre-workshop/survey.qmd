# Survey {#sec-survey}

We have a [Code of Conduct](https://guides.rostools.org/conduct.html).
If you haven't read it, **read it now**. The survey involves a question
about Conduct. We want to make sure this workshop is a supportive and safe
environment for learning, so this Code of Conduct is quite important.

If you haven't read the sections under "Workshop overview" and
"Pre-workshop tasks", **please read them now**.

Also make sure to read the [Code of
conduct](https://guides.rostools.org/conduct.html), since the survey
involves a question about it. We want to make sure this workshop is a
supportive and safe environment for learning, so this is quite
important.

You're almost done. Please fill out the pre-workshop survey to finish
