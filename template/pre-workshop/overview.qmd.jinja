# Overview {{ '{#sec-pre-workshop}' }}

In order to participate in this workshop, you must complete everything
in this section and finish with **completing the
[survey](/pre-workshop/survey.qmd)** at the end. These tasks are
meant to provide everyone with the necessary setup and a shared
foundation for the workshop.

Depending on your prior knowledge and skills, these tasks could take
between **TIME hrs to finish**, so we suggest planning some time to
complete them. While many of the tasks are mostly readings, they are
important in making sure you get the most out of the workshop.

## Summary of tasks

Here's a quick overview of the tasks you need to do. Specific details
about them are found as you work through the tasks.

If you haven't already, go through the workshop overview section,
including the [Syllabus](/overview/syllabus.qmd), [Is this for
you?](/overview/is-this-for-you.qmd), and [Learning
design](/overview/learning-design.qmd) to get an overview of what this
workshop contains and the learning design behind the workshop material.

After that, please go through the the pre-workshop tasks designed to
establish a shared foundation for the start of the workshop. This
includes:

1.  Install a version of R, RStudio, Quarto, and Git that is as updated
    as possible. For some people, depending on their institution, this
    task can take the **longest amount of time** because you have to
    contact your IT to install these packages.
2.  Install necessary R packages.
3.  TODO: Add more tasks
4.  Read the syllabus (@sec-syllabus).
5.  Read the [Code of
    Conduct](https://guides.rostools.org/conduct.html).
6.  Complete the pre-workshop [survey](survey.qmd): This survey is pretty quick,
    maybe \~10 minutes. There will be some bits from the tasks that you
    will need to paste into this survey.

Check each section for exact details on completing these tasks.
